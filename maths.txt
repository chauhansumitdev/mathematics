vectors
cv+dw 
fundamental operations - addition and multiplication
- linear combination

linear combination is multiplication of two vectors v and w with c and d respectively and then summing of the result.

for a two dimensional vector it can be represented by a [x y]
where x is the x dist and y is the y dist

similarly there is a three dimensional vector - [x y z]

the length of the vector is the multiplication of the vector with itself - in other sense it  is the dot product of the vector with itself[x1 y1].[x1 y1]
then the result obtained is sq root .
this is the single valued result - if the val is -ve the angle is greater than 90 if 0 90 and if +ve then the angle is smaller than 90

one more conclusion can be derived from this is that we can calculate the unit vector - its like a vector having length 1, 
mathematically vector having the xvalsq + yvalsq = 1, that is actually the hypot,
now this can be done for any vector - just by dividing the co-ordinates of the vector with its length.

let there are two unit vectors u and v ( ||unit vector|| == 1) 
then their dot product gives the cosine of the angle between them.

two important inequality =
Schwarz inequality = |v.u| <= ||v||||u||
Triangle inequality = ||v+w|| <= ||v|| + ||u||

Solving Linear Equations
the idea of elimination


a system of linaer eq can have no sol, unique sol or many sols

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

the coordinate system can also be changed for changing the reference of the vector being addressed in reference to another vector
this is basis vector.

crux - the matrix is a function sort of(not directly saying but it seems like) that transforms the vector to something new vector in the space.
